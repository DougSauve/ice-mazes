Sunday, Sep 23 (1:30)
1. Get an elegant finish to the game after the last level

Monday, Set 24 1:45
fixed: new game and resume game aren't behaving properly
fixed game loading twice and triggering unmounted component setState, other similar optimizations



further:

style controls, instructions, and win
add controls to bottom panel and instructions to top panel
Add locks and keys and inventory functionality... switches to raise/lower blocks?
Add multi-floor functionality, including ladders, spirals and landings


bugs:
clicking outside of the game or something removes the event listener for the arrow keys
win messages are being called twice. I think a few things are. edit: this only happens with the developer tools. I think this might be something at the browser level that I can't reach.
